        <h2>Hi, I'm Xyste Chrysologue Rabearson</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a passionate frontend developer creating clean, responsive
          websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m currently studying
          Software Development at BYU-Idaho.

        <h2>My Journey into Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          My journey in web development started when I worked with a friend who
          was learning Python. Intrigued by his progress, I decided to start
          learning alongside him. However, I quickly realized that self-training
          was more challenging than I anticipated. I wanted a more structured
          path, so I searched for affordable courses that could guide me. That's
          when I discovered the BYU Pathway program, an incredible program
          offering certificates in various fields. I chose the Software
          Development path, which required completion of the Web and Computer
          Programming Certificate and the Web Development Certificate. This is
          where my real journey into web development began, and I’ve been
          passionately working towards my goal ever since.

        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>
          My ultimate goal is to become a software developer who solves real
          problems and makes people's lives easier through innovative solutions.
          I’m particularly interested in building systems that improve everyday
          experiences, whether through web applications, software tools, or
          other technological solutions.

      <section class="about-section current-focus">
        <h2>Current Focus</h2>
        <p>
          As of now, I am still a student at BYU-Idaho, pursuing my degree in
          Software Development. I am currently focusing on completing courses
          that enhance my skills in web development, particularly in front-end
          technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m also gaining hands-on
          experience through projects that help solidify my understanding of web
          design principles and responsive layouts.

        <h2>Fun Facts About Me</h2>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, I love playing guitar, singing with friends, and
          trying new foods. I believe in the importance of balance, so I make
          time for music and social activities to refresh my mind.
